 Against the background of the creation of a European Qualifications Framework, this paper compares the VET systems of England, Germany and The Netherlands.
的背景下,建立一个欧洲资格框架,本文比较了兽医系统英格兰、德国和荷兰。

 The analysis reveals the distinct understandings and meanings of outwardly similar terms.
表面上的分析揭示了不同的理解和意义类似的条款。

 These meanings are deeply rooted in the countriesÕ institutional structures and labour processes and still inform national debates and policies today.
这些含义深深植根于countriesO体制结构和劳动过程和今天仍然通知国家辩论和政策。

 The paper identifies a major distinction between a Ôknowledge-basedÕ VET model in Germany and The Netherlands and a Ôskills-basedÕ model in England.

 There is a need to develop trans-national categories that take into account the social construction of terms such as ÔskillsÕ and ÔqualificationsÕ.

IntroductionPressures for convergence of vocational education and training (VET) systems in Factors frequently cited include socio-economic changes and global economic pres- sures which are said to have triggered broadly similar responses across the major European countries (Boreham, 2002a).
IntroductionPressures收敛的职业教育和培训(兽医)系统频繁引用的因素包括社会经济的变化和全球经济施压的suresh据说引发类似的反应整个欧洲主要国家(Boreham, 2002)。

 Others point to the many initiatives at European Union level.
其他人指出许多倡议在欧盟层面。

 Ertl, for example, argues that within the EU, educational policy has always been an important tool for achieving stated economic aims, notably free movement of goods, services and capital (2002).
Ertl为例,认为欧盟内部,教育政策一直是一个重要工具实现既定的经济目标,尤其是自由流动的商品、服务和资本(2002)。

 Recent policy developments, notably the Lisbon European Council in 2000, initiated specific measures in education and training to ensure the EUÕs global economic competitiveness.

as integral to achieving this goal.
作为实现这一目标的积分。

 In 2002, the Copenhagen Declaration on enhancedEuropean co-operation in VET laid down plans for building a true European labour market through trans-national recognition of vocational qualifications and improving national VET systems (Coles & Oates, 2004).
2002年哥本哈根宣言在兽医enhancedEuropean合作制定计划建立一个真正的欧洲劳动力市场通过跨国的职业资格和提高国家兽医系统(高斯&欧茨,2004)。

 This process culminated in the devel- opment of a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) (European Commission, 2006), intended to serve as a mechanism enabling comparability between national qualification systems, thus enhancing transferability and mobility of labour.
这个过程最终以重击——欧洲星航工程科从事资格框架(EQF)(欧洲委员会,2006),旨在作为一种机制使国家资格系统之间的可比性,从而增强了可转让性和劳动力流动。

While this process follows previous attempts at creating equivalence frameworks(Cedefop, 2006; Coles, 2006), it crucially builds on outputs or learning outcomes of qualifications rather than inputs, seen as the only way of ensuring that the framework can be operationalised (Coles & Oates, 2004; Winterton et al.
虽然这个过程遵循先前的尝试创建等效框架(著,2006;

, 2005).
, 2005).

 This approacharguably is closest to the English National Qualifications Framework, and has been criticised sharply as it would risk fragmenting European VET systems based on holis- tic notions of occupations and qualifications (Rauner & Grollmann, 2006).
这个approacharguably最接近英语国家资格框架,并大幅被批评,因为这可能分裂欧洲兽医系统基于好丽诗——抽搐的职业观念和资格(Rauner & Grollmann, 2006)。

 However, others have pointed out that stakeholders across Europe welcomed the EQF as it stimulated the debate in their own countries and advanced moves towards developing learning outcomes, seen by many as a vital means for improving comparability and transferability at national level (Bjırnavold & Coles, 2006; Hanf, 2006).
不过,也有人指出,整个欧洲的利益相关者对EQF表示欢迎,因为它刺激辩论在他们自己的国家和发达国家向发展中学习成果,被视为一个重要的手段提高可比性和可转让性国家级(Bjırnavold &科尔斯,2006;

 The EQF was developed by the European Commission on the basis of expert groups from all EU countries.
EQF是由欧洲委员会的基础上,从所有欧盟国家专家小组。

 To describe learning outcomes, the Framework grades qualifications according to eight reference levels and across three dimensions: knowledge, skills and competences (Winterton et al.
框架来描述学习成果,根据八等级资格参考水平和跨三个维度:知识、技能和能力(Winterton et al。

, 2005).
, 2005).

Against this background, this paper will explore the VET systems of three Europeancountries (England, Germany and the Netherlands), examining in detail the debates and policy responses in each country.
在此背景下,本文将探讨的兽医系统三个欧洲国家(英国、德国和荷兰),详细检查辩论,在每个国家的政策回应。

 National and European policy debates on employability, lifelong learning and developments towards competence-based approaches in particular may appear outwardly close, using similar or even identical terms.
全国就业能力和欧洲的政策辩论,终身学习和发展对能力本位方法尤其可能出现表面上接近,使用相似甚至相同的术语。

 The paper will highlight the need for contextualising these and related concepts in order to understand fully their particular meanings.
本文将强调需要才是原作者这些和相关概念以充分理解他们的特殊含义。

 It will be argued that it is of crucial importance to take into account the social construction and historical embed- dedness of concepts if the European Qualifications Framework is to succeed.
有人会争辩说,这是至关重要的考虑到概念的社会建设和历史嵌入——dedness如果欧洲资格框架是成功。

The paper will examine the key terms on which the EQF is based.
本文将研究的关键术语EQF。

 The latter appearsto have adopted the Anglo-Saxon definitions of ÔknowledgeÕ, ÔskillsÕ and Ôcompe- tenceÕ, used as the indicators of learning outcomes, without due consideration of the meanings of these terms in different national contexts.
后者比采用了盎格鲁-撒克逊的定义OknowledgeO, OskillsO和Ocompe tenceO,用作学习成果的指标,没有考虑这些术语的含义在不同的国家背景。

 The first section will analyse some of the key principles as they underpin and define national VET systems, such as the role of ÔknowledgeÕ and ÔcompetenceÕ.
第一部分将分析的一些主要原则支撑和定义国家兽医系统,如OknowledgeO和OcompetenceO的角色。

 In subsequent sections, the paper will examine the ways in which the concepts are embedded and operationalised within the different national systems.
在随后的章节中,本文将研究的方式嵌入的概念和在不同国家operationalised系统。

 It will explore the meaning of qualifications and their signif- icance in the labour market, as well as the role of general and civic education within VET.
它将探索资格的含义及其signif——icance在劳动力市场,以及在兽医一般公民教育的作用。

 In relation to current debates and initiatives, particularly on employability, the analysis will draw out important differences in the meanings of ÔcompetenciesÕ and Ôlearning outcomesÕ and will further our understanding of the different rationales behind national moves towards developing a competence-based approach.
相对于当前的辩论和举措,特别是在就业能力,分析画出重要意义的差异OcompetenciesO和Olearning outcomesO,我们将进一步了解不同的国家走向发展能力本位方法背后的基本原理。

 The mainDownloaded By: [University of Westminster] At: 09:24 17 September 2008 Vocational education and training in Europe549conclusion is that a major distinction needs to be made between two VET models: aknowledge-based model operating in Germany and the Netherlands, and a skills- based model in England.
的mainDownloaded:(威斯敏斯特大学):于2008年九月十七日09:24 Europe549conclusion职业教育和培训是主要需要注意区分两个兽医模型:aknowledge-based模型操作在德国和荷兰,在英格兰和技能——建立模型。

 The analysis suggests that, because of the particular intrinsic and context-bound meanings of VET systems and their underlying principles, there is a need for developing trans-national categories to which common comparators of qualifications can refer.
分析表明,由于特定的内在和context-bound审查系统的含义及其基本原则,需要发展跨国分类,常见的资格可以参考比较器。

Qualifications, ÔemployabilityÕ and competence-based approachesIn most European countries, there have been debates about developing VET appro-priate to what is commonly referred to as a Ôknowledge-basedÕ society, as economies have moved from a Taylorist-Fordist system of mass production, relying on a narrow specialisation of tasks and strict division of labour, to an organisation of work charac- terised by greater use of technology, flatter hierarchies and employees deployed across functions and departments (Boreham et al.
资格、OemployabilityO和能力本位approachesIn大多数欧洲国家,有争论发展中兽医appro-priate什么是通常被称为一个Oknowledge-basedO的社会,随着经济从Taylorist-Fordist系统的大规模生产,依靠一个狭窄的专业化的任务和严格的分工,一个组织的工作——terised使用更多的技术,奉承层次结构和员工部署在功能和部门(Boreham et al。

, 2002).
, 2002).

 There has been an increasingdemand for abstract ÔknowledgeÕ, a need to understand the whole labour process and to deal with ÔriskÕ and unpredictable situations.
已经有一个increasingdemand抽象OknowledgeO,需要了解整个劳动过程和处理OriskO和不可预知的情况。

 Employers have placed greater empha- sis on personal attributes, such as problem-solving, independent decision-making and the ability to communicate with colleagues.
雇主,更强调sis放在个人属性,如解决问题、独立决策和与同事沟通的能力。

 At the same time, there have been demands for a more flexible use of labour and a new emphasis on lifelong learning and less on initial VET (Ertl & Sloane, 2004).
同时,要求更灵活使用劳动和一个新的强调终身学习和减少对初始审查(Ertl &斯隆,2004)。

 This has not been an even process within national economies and the term Ôknowledge-based societyÕ is particularly ambiguous in England, where there has been a much greater emphasis on ÔskillsÕ (as opposed to ÔknowledgeÕ).
这没有一个甚至过程在国民经济和术语Oknowledge-based societyO尤为模糊在英格兰,那里有更大的强调OskillsO(而不是OknowledgeO)。

 This concept of ÔskillsÕ has to be treated with particular caution.
这个概念的OskillsO必须特别谨慎地对待。

 In England, it is generally regarded as an individual attribute, associated with manual dexterity, attached to specific tasks or output and with no particular association with a knowledge base (Clarke & Winch, 2006a).
在英格兰,它通常被视为一个单独的属性,与手工灵巧,附加到特定任务或输出并没有特定的协会与知识库(克拉克&绞车,2006)。

 It is a term situated in the ÔworkÕ process, associated with the results of labour and thus with the actual site or location of ÔworkÕ or output, rather than in the Ôlabour processÕ, associated with labour input and thus with a range of dimensions including the division of labour into different occupations.
这是位于OworkO过程,与劳动的结果,因此与实际网站或OworkO或输出的位置,而不是在Olabour processO,与劳动力的输入有关,因此预防与一系列维度包括分工到不同的职业。

Describing different qualifications strategies, Rauner (2006) distinguishes betweenVET systems which focus on education for an occupation (Berufliche Bildung) on theone hand, and those which are aimed at employability of individuals, on the other.
描述不同的条件策略,Rauner(2006)区分betweenVET系统关注职业教育(Berufliche教化)在某一回一方面,和那些针对个人的就业能力,。

 In the first type, VET is integrated into a comprehensive school system and is designed to achieve ability to act competently within an occupational field.
在第一类,兽医是集成到一个全面的学校系统,旨在实现行动能力胜任地在一个职业领域。

 Qualifications are obtained through the successful completion of courses developed through negotiation with the social partners (trade unions and employers), integrating theoretical knowl- edge and workplace learning.
资格是通过协商成功完成课程开发与社会合作伙伴(工会和雇主),整合理论知识——边缘和工作场所的学习。

 In the second model, a Ômarket of qualificationsÕ enables individuals to enhance their employability through certification of competencies, acquired either through work experience or courses in a modularised system.
在第二个模型中,Omarket qualificationsO允许个人通过认证的能力,提高他们的就业能力获得通过工作经验或课程模块化系统。

 The nature and type of competencies are determined both by market mechanisms and decisions taken by individuals in order to enhance their careers or income.
的性质和类型由市场机制和决策能力都决定由个人为了提高他们的职业和收入。

 As Rauner points out, this requires a high level of general education on the part of individuals in order to enable them to make those decisions.
Rauner指出,这需要一个高水平的通识教育的个体为了使他们能够做出这些决定。
